## Terrior's Linux Dotfiles
Welcome to my linux dotfiles repo. This repo uses my personal project, Templater, to generate a set of config files. Look at its repo here for more information on how to use it. Templater is provided with this repo, so you don't need to install it. To configure the output, simply edit the top section of config.txt and run Templater. Wallpapers and themes are provided as well.

To download this repo and generate dotfiles, use: 

    git clone --recursive
